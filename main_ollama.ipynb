For example, one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics. Still, another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies. Learning who you are as a person can take time and life experience. At the same time, who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them. Try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing. Allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to the experiences you have. This may help you to know more about what you value, what you like and dislike, and what you want for yourself in life. Best of luck to you!\n",
      "Database Patient: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.\n",
      "Database Response: The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% \"there.\" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of \"what already is\" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..\n",
      "Database Patient: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.\n",
      "Database Response: Three years ago I attended a week long meditation retreat. By the fifth day I noticed I was light headed and felt very strange. I began to realize within my own being an experience of no separation. I would see others at the retreat and smile. I loved them all. I could feel the connection with this awareness I had read about but never truly understood until that moment. I remember understanding all the teachings I had learned throughout my life about a god who existed outside of me. I realized I had all these answeres within my own being and so did everyone else. I began to see everyone as not just capable but powerful loving beings. Since this experience it has been my desire for everyone to become conscious within whatever experience they wish. I do this in many ways. At our studio we combine Mental Health with yoga and meditation as well as nutrition counseling to help people come to their optimal selves. To truly come into a state of \"finding yourself,\" is to start to know and own who you are from a state of solid being. In this there is nothing new under the sun, and it is very simple. I would love to teach you and anyone interested in coming into a state of awake conciousness.  The more awake we are the more joyful we are. I live in this state of being and demonstrate it in my daily life.\n",
      "Database Patient: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.\n",
      "Database Response: Therapy may be an effective way for you to get a stronger sense of who you are. A competent therapist will work to create a safe and curious therapeutic relationship in which you can explore your identity. There are also many different exercises which you can do in and out of therapy which you may find helpful in this area as well.\n",
      "Database Patient: I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.\n",
      "Database Response: This quiet wonder that you have is something you can easily explore. There is a part of you that you can access anytime, anywhere. It is the part that has always been with you. Find a quiet place where you can be alone for a while and get comfortable. Settle in. Let your thoughts go by like a river. Stay with that connection for a while. What you find in the silence is yours alone, your \"you\".\n",

      "I understand that finding yourself and determining one's identity can be a challenging and overwhelming experience, and I'm here to offer support and guidance. Based on our previous conversations, it seems like you've been searching for clarity on who you are and what makes you unique. For someone else in this situation, mindfulness of \"what already is\" has been key to finding themselves. Aligning with people, activities, and experiences that bring joy and fulfillment can help shape one's sense of self. This individual notes that by combining mental health practices like yoga and meditation with nutrition counseling, they've been able to cultivate a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. As I reflect on my own journey, I realize that discovering one's identity is not about external validation but rather tapping into inner wisdom and awareness. It's essential to acknowledge our values, passions, and strengths, as well as recognizing areas where we might need growth and improvement. By being more mindful of these aspects of ourselves, we can develop a stronger sense of purpose and direction.\n"
